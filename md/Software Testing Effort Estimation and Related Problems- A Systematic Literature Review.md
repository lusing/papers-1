# Software Testing Effort Estimation and Related Problems: A Systematic Literature Review

Although testing effort estimation is a very important task in software project management, it is rarely described in the literature. There are many difficulties in finding any useful methods or tools for this purpose. Solutions to many other problems related to testing effort calculation are published much more often. There is also no research focusing on both testing effort estimation and all related areas of software engineering. To fill this gap, we performed a systematic literature review on both questions. Although our primary objective was to find some tools or implementable metods for test effort estimation, we have quickly discovered many other interesting topics related to the main one. The main contribution of this work is the presentation of the testing effort estimation task in a very wide context, indicating the relations with other research fields. This systematic literature review presents a detailed overview of testing effort estimation task, including challenges and approaches to automating it and the solutions proposed in the literature. It also exhaustively investigates related research topics, classifying publications that can be found in connection to the testing effort according to seven criteria formulated on the basis of our research questions. We present here both synthesis of our finding and the deep analysis of the stated research problems.

尽管测试工作量估算是软件项目管理中一项非常重要的任务，但在文献中很少对其进行描述。为此目的寻找任何有用的方法或工具有很多困难。与测试工作量计算相关的许多其他问题的解决方案发布得更频繁。也没有针对测试工作量估算和软件工程所有相关领域的研究。为了填补这一空白，我们对这两个问题进行了系统的文献综述。尽管我们的主要目标是找到一些工具或可实现的测试工作量估算方法，但我们很快发现了许多其他与主要主题相关的有趣主题。这项工作的主要贡献是在非常广泛的背景下介绍测试工作量估计任务，表明与其他研究领域的关系。这篇系统的文献综述详细概述了测试工作量估计任务，包括自动化它的挑战和方法以及文献中提出的解决方案。它还详尽地调查了相关的研究主题，根据基于我们的研究问题制定的七个标准，对与测试工作相关的出版物进行分类。我们在这里展示了我们发现的综合和对所述研究问题的深入分析。

## 4 THREATS TO VALIDITY

We are aware that our survey, like others, has some limitations. The main source of the threats to validity of this study is the manner of conducting the literature review. The number of searched data sources is by nature limited, and although we also conducted the research on the Internet, there is still a chance that we have missed some important research. Moreover, in majority of papers only abstracts and conclusions were analyzed. That is the result of the fact that a huge amount of publications did not cover testing effort estimation problem, but are dedicated to other topics. The other danger to the correctness of our observations is that the study was performed in three parts, in different periods of time. Furthermore, every time different papers were found and although the publication years were limited during the database search, there was no such limit in the Internet search, so each timewe found fewpapers published not as recently aswe had expected. If we regarded them vital, we included them in our results. However, we have come across some papers new to us, but published before the beginning of our research, when the whole SLR was already conducted and described. Such publications, e.g., References [33, 62], are omitted in this article, as their addition would require the changes in presented numerical data. Although we have prepared some quantitative data in the form of number of papers belonging to each category of each classification type, we have not conducted any numerical quality assessment of testing effort estimation methods. We have focused only on the qualitative description of characteristics of the identified approaches. The number of papers identified during each phase of our research also varies. There is a disproportion in number of papers from different periods of search: There are many papers from the short periods of time, i.e., 2016–2018 and 2018–2019.We have also excluded some articles on topics other than testing effort estimation in the second stage of the research to make our work more focused on our main goal. Finally, this SLR was prepared without any special tool, nor any environment, which would significantly facilitate the whole process. The only facilitations we have used were the search engines and MS Excel, but the whole data extraction, bibliography management, and consistency assurance was done manually.



## 5 CONCLUSIONS

Despite the fact that software testing effort estimation seems to be a very important task, there exist extremely limited number of scientific approaches to solve that problem. In this article, we have presented the current state-of-the-art of the testing estimation domain, andwe have discussed many related topics. The undeniable contribution of this work is that it not only enumerates tasks related to testing effort calculation, but it also comprehensively describes them and illustrates the problems in finding specific solutions prepared for test estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that treats the problem of testing effort estimation in the context of all related software-engineering topics, and we believe it is our main contribution. Moreover, some solutions that claim to solve the testing estimation problem turn out to be of very doubtful quality, and here we have identified and criticized them. We have classified all selected papers according to seven criteria based on our research questions. The papers covering testing effort estimation question directly form less than a half of all selected papers and only a small part of all search results. Those publications were carefully analyzed and described. In fact, the other advantage of this SLR is that it proves the lack of testing effort-specific solutions using the concrete numbers—the number of papers on testing effort estimation in contrast to the (already filtered) number of papers on other topics. Although we made our best efforts to perform this survey in a systematic and clear manner, it is not free from some threats to validity, e.g., the limited number of analyzed papers and data sources, possibility of manual errors introduction, some subjective or informal decisions that cause the difficulty in exact repetition of this SLR. They may have a small impact on the numeric results presented in this article but do not affect the general conclusions and observations.

尽管软件测试工作量估算似乎是一项非常重要的任务，但解决该问题的科学方法数量极其有限。在本文中，我们介绍了测试估计领域的当前最新技术，并讨论了许多相关主题。这项工作不可否认的贡献在于，它不仅列举了与测试工作量计算相关的任务，而且还全面描述了这些任务，并说明了寻找为测试估计准备的特定解决方案时存在的问题。据我们所知，这是在所有相关软件工程主题的背景下处理测试工作量估计问题的第一项工作，我们相信这是我们的主要贡献。此外，一些声称解决测试估计问题的解决方案的质量非常可疑，我们在这里对它们进行了识别和批评。我们根据我们的研究问题，根据七个标准对所有选定的论文进行了分类。涉及测试工作量估计问题的论文直接占所有入选论文的不到一半，仅占所有搜索结果的一小部分。这些出版物都经过仔细分析和描述。事实上，这个 SLR 的另一个优点是它使用具体数字证明了测试工作特定解决方案的缺乏——测试工作量估计的论文数量与其他主题的（已经过滤的）论文数量形成对比。尽管我们尽最大努力以系统和清晰的方式进行这项调查，但它仍然存在一些有效性威胁，例如，分析的论文和数据来源数量有限，引入人工错误的可能性，一些主观或非正式的决定这导致难以准确重复此 SLR。它们可能对本文中呈现的数值结果产生很小的影响，但不会影响一般结论和观察结果。

In this SLR, we explained that it is difficult to find any solutions for the testing effort estimation problem among many papers on related topics. There is lack of analytical methods and often experience-based approaches are used. There are almost no reliable tools for testing effort estimation, and the industry also does not use any testing effort estimation-specific tool support. The most popular analytical methods among the academic researchers are TPA [168] and UCP [117]. These solutions are about 20 years old and although they are still modified by different new approaches, they lack modern methods. The growing interest in the area of test estimation can be observed in the past 10 years, but still there are almost no interesting results. It all indicates that testing effort estimation considered as a separate problem should be further investigated.

在这个 SLR 中，我们解释说，在许多相关主题的论文中，很难找到测试工作量估计问题的任何解决方案。 缺乏分析方法，通常使用基于经验的方法。 几乎没有可靠的测试工作量估算工具，业界也没有使用任何特定于测试工作量估算的工具支持。 学术研究人员中最流行的分析方法是 TPA [168] 和 UCP [117]。 这些解决方案已有大约 20 年的历史，尽管它们仍在通过不同的新方法进行修改，但它们缺乏现代方法。 在过去的 10 年中可以观察到对测试估计领域越来越感兴趣，但仍然几乎没有有趣的结果。 这一切都表明，应该进一步研究将测试工作量估算视为一个单独的问题。
