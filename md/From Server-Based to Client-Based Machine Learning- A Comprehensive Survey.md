# From Server-Based to Client-Based Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Survey

In recent years, mobile devices have gained increasing development with stronger computation capability and larger storage space. Some of the computation-intensive machine learning tasks can now be run on mobile devices. To exploit the resources available on mobile devices and preserve personal privacy, the concept of client-based machine learning has been proposed. It leverages the users’ local hardware and local data to solvemachine learning sub-problems on mobile devices and only uploads computation results rather than the original data for the optimization of the global model. Such an architecture can not only relieve computation and storage burdens on servers but also protect the users’ sensitive information. Another benefit is the bandwidth reduction because various kinds of local data can be involved in the training process without being uploaded. In this article, we provide a literature review on the progressive development of machine learning from server based to client based.We revisit a number of widely used server-based and client-based machine learning methods and applications. We also extensively discuss the challenges and future directions in this area. We believe that this survey will give a clear overview of client-based machine learning and provide guidelines on applying client-based machine learning to practice.

近年来，移动设备以更强大的计算能力和更大的存储空间获得了越来越多的发展。现在，某些计算密集型机器学习任务可以在移动设备上运行。为了利用移动设备上可用的资源并保护个人隐私，已经提出了基于客户端的机器学习的概念。它利用用户的本地硬件和本地数据来解决移动设备上的机器学习子问题，并且仅上传计算结果而不是原始数据来优化全局模型。这种架构不仅可以减轻服务器的计算和存储负担，还可以保护用户的敏感信息。另一个好处是减少了带宽，因为各种本地数据可以参与训练过程而无需上载。在本文中，我们提供了有关从基于服务器到基于客户端的机器学习的逐步发展的文献综述。我们还将广泛讨论该领域的挑战和未来方向。我们相信，本次调查将清晰地概述基于客户端的机器学习，并提供有关将基于客户端的机器学习应用于实践的指南。

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Machine learning, especially deep learning, has become a hot topic, attracting tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The core idea of machine learning is to use large amounts of data to train a model that can generalize well to unseen test samples. However, with the increase of data volume and the enhancement of model capacity, it is infeasible for a single server to accomplish complex learning tasks in a centralized way. To address this problem, the concept of server-based distributed machine learning was proposed in [82], where multiple servers, connected through shared data buses or a fast local area network, exchange essential information (e.g., training losses and gradients) to collaboratively train a model. Although this framework is highly scalable and has been widely deployed in practice, it may not always be cost effective and efficient to build a high-performance server cluster. In addition to cost, security and privacy are major concerns when machine learning involves sensitive user data, such as typed texts in natural language processing, user profiles in personalized recommendations, and health records in medical diagnosis. Specifically, the servers in both centralized and distributed machine learning frameworks require direct accesses to training data and thus need to collect and store user data, which inevitably suffers outsider and insider attacks [79–81]. For example, a malicious hacker may invade the datacenter, compromise parts of servers, and leak private databases. Further, if the servers are untrusted, they may share user data with other unauthorized entities or even trade for profits. In a nutshell, how to reduce the server cluster’s operation cost, how the trusted servers can securelymaintain user data, and how to defend untrusted servers are bottlenecks of the server-based machine learning.

机器学习（尤其是深度学习）已成为热门话题，引起了学术界和行业的极大关注。机器学习的核心思想是使用大量数据来训练一个模型，该模型可以很好地推广到看不见的测试样本。但是，随着数据量的增加和模型容量的增加，单个服务器以集中方式完成复杂的学习任务是不可行的。为了解决这个问题，在[82]中提出了基于服务器的分布式机器学习的概念，其中通过共享数据总线或快速局域网连接的多个服务器通过协作交换必要的信息（例如，训练损失和梯度）训练模型。尽管此框架具有高度可伸缩性，并且已在实践中广泛部署，但是构建高性能服务器群集可能并不总是具有成本效益和效率的。除了成本之外，当机器学习涉及敏感的用户数据（例如自然语言处理中的键入文本，个性化推荐中的用户配置文件以及医学诊断中的健康记录）时，安全性和隐私也是主要关注的问题。具体来说，集中式和分布式机器学习框架中的服务器都需要直接访问培训数据，因此需要收集和存储用户数据，这不可避免地遭受外部和内部攻击[79-81]。例如，恶意黑客可能入侵数据中心，破坏了服务器的某些部分，并泄露了私有数据库。此外，如果服务器不受信任，它们可能会与其他未授权实体共享用户数据，甚至会牟取暴利。简而言之，如何减少服务器群集的运行成本，如何信任服务器如何安全地维护用户数据以及如何保护不受信任的服务器是基于服务器的机器学习的瓶颈。

Meanwhile, with the rapid proliferation and development of mobile devices, the idea of doing machine learning tasks onmobile devices has also emerged. For example, applications, such as face recognition and speech recognition, are all based onmachine learning and are common among mobile phones. To support these applications, a full-sized machine learning model is first trained on servers using large amounts of data, and then it is tailored and delivered to mobile devices to do inference and make predictions locally. This framework brings all the burdens to the central servers, wasting the resources of mobile devices, whose processors, memory space, and disk space are now powerful and abundant enough to support various kinds of computation tasks. In addition, many off-the-shelf machine learning frameworks (e.g., the TensorFlow Lite module in TensorFlow [1]) are now available. Developers can now readily adopt these end-to-end tools to build machine learning models for their mobile applications. The above evidences have shown that it is feasible to deploy distributed training tasks on mobile devices, which is also called client-based training.

同时，随着移动设备的迅速普及和发展，在移动设备上执行机器学习任务的想法也应运而生。例如，诸如面部识别和语音识别之类的应用程序都是基于机器学习的，并且在移动电话中很常见。为了支持这些应用程序，首先在服务器上使用大量数据对全尺寸的机器学习模型进行训练，然后将其定制并交付给移动设备以进行推断并在本地进行预测。该框架将所有负担带给了中央服务器，浪费了移动设备的资源，移动设备的处理器，内存空间和磁盘空间现在功能强大且足够丰富，可以支持各种计算任务。另外，现在有许多现成的机器学习框架（例如，TensorFlow [1]中的TensorFlow Lite模块）可用。开发人员现在可以轻松地使用这些端到端工具来为其移动应用程序构建机器学习模型。以上证据表明，在移动设备上部署分布式培训任务是可行的，这也称为基于客户端的培训。

Client-based training has advantages in cost reduction and privacy preservation. In particular, machine learning problems are distributed to mobile devices and solved locally so that highperformance servers and user data transmission/maintenance are no longer required. The idea of client-based training can be traced back to 2015, when Shokri and Shmatikov [100] proposed distributed deep learning without sharing datasets among multiple parties. Later that year, Google researchers designed federated optimization [54], aiming to improve communication efficiency during learning with decentralized datasets. The idea was also referred to as Federated Learning and further developed in the following years [53, 55, 56, 70]. These works can be generally viewed as a specific type of client-based training that mainly focuses on how to make use of data without uploading them to the server, so that the privacy of users can be well preserved. If we enable on-device training and only upload the computation results, the leakage of sensitive information can be relieved. The reason is that attacks against the computation results without accessing the raw data are much harder. Moreover, since raw data is processed locally, client-based training is now able to make use of the data that is too much to be uploaded (so that centralized machine learning doesn’t take them into consideration), which gives us great opportunity to improve the model performance.

以客户为基础的训练在降低成本和保护隐私方面具有优势。特别是，机器学习问题被分配到移动设备并在本地解决，这样就不再需要高性能的服务器和用户数据传输/维护。基于客户端的训练的思想可以追溯到2015年，当时Shokri和Shmatikov[100]提出了分布式深度学习，不需要多方共享数据集。同年晚些时候，谷歌的研究人员设计了联邦优化[54]，旨在提高使用分散数据集学习时的通信效率。这种思想也被称为联邦学习，并在随后的几年中得到进一步发展[53,55,56,70]。这些工作一般可以看作是一种特定类型的基于客户端的训练，主要关注如何在不将数据上传到服务器的情况下利用数据，从而很好地保护用户的隐私。如果启用设备上训练，只上传计算结果，可以缓解敏感信息的泄露。原因是，在不访问原始数据的情况下对计算结果进行攻击要困难得多。此外，由于原始数据是在本地处理的，基于客户端的训练现在可以利用太多无法上传的数据(集中式机器学习不会考虑这些数据)，这给了我们很大的机会来提高模型的性能。

Compared to existing surveys in this area, this survey focuses on the evolution process of machine learning. From server-based machine learning to client-based machine learning, the application scenarios and the research problems have greatly changed.We summarize the changes and further investigate the underlying motivations. We also review the research focuses at different stages of machine learning development. In particular, considering that a lot of new features and new demands have emerged in client-based machine learning, we analyze the applicability of existing server-based algorithms to client-based machine learning. We finally point out some future directions of client-based machine learning. In a nutshell, this survey not only is a review of the development of machine learning but also can work as a good reference for designing new clientbased learning algorithms on the basis of conventional server-based methods.

与该领域现有的研究相比，本研究聚焦于机器学习的进化过程。从基于服务器的机器学习到基于客户端的机器学习，其应用场景和研究问题都发生了很大的变化。我们总结了这些变化，并进一步研究了潜在的动机。本文还对机器学习发展不同阶段的研究重点进行了综述。特别是考虑到基于客户端的机器学习出现了很多新特征和新需求，我们分析了现有的基于服务器的算法对基于客户端的机器学习的适用性。最后指出了基于客户端的机器学习的未来发展方向。总之，这个调查不仅是对机器学习发展的回顾，而且对于在传统的基于服务器的方法基础上设计新的基于客户端的学习算法具有很好的参考价值。

The rest of this survey is organized as follows. In Section 2 and Section 3, we introduce the general machine learning process and the methodology of server-based distributed training. In Section 4 and Section 5, we explain the motivations of client-based machine learning (including inference and training), list the challenges, and discuss current advances of client-based training using federated learning and split learning as examples. In Section 6, we discuss the open problems and future directions of client-based training. Finally, we conclude the survey in Section 7.

本次调查的其余部分组织如下。在第2节和第3节中，我们将介绍通用的机器学习过程和基于服务器的分布式培训方法。在第4节和第5节中，我们将解释基于客户端的机器学习的动机(包括推理和训练)，列出挑战，并使用联邦学习和分割学习作为示例讨论基于客户端的训练的当前进展。在第六部分，我们讨论了基于客户的培训存在的问题和未来的发展方向。最后，我们在第7节对调查进行总结。

## 2 CENTRALIZED MACHINE LEARNING

## 3 SERVER-BASED DISTRIBUTED TRAINING

## 4 CLIENT-BASED INFERENCE

In contrast to server-based machine learning where all operations over the model (including training and inference) are conducted on servers, client-based machine learning intends to pull down some computation tasks to clients so that the quality of service can be improved in terms of response latency, personalization, security privacy, and so on. Based on the execution phase, we divide client-based machine learning into client-based inference and client-based training. Clientbased inference focuses on the local execution of trained machine learning models. In this section, we discuss the necessity and the feasibility of client-based inference.

与基于服务器的机器学习不同，该模型上的所有操作（包括训练和推理）都在服务器上进行，而基于客户端的机器学习则打算将一些计算任务下放给客户端，从而可以提高服务质量 响应延迟，个性化，安全性隐私等等。 在执行阶段的基础上，我们将基于客户端的机器学习分为基于客户端的推理和基于客户端的训练。 基于客户端的推理着重于训练有素的机器学习模型的本地执行。 在本节中，我们讨论基于客户端的推理的必要性和可行性。

## 5 CLIENT-BASED TRAINING

Client-based training is mainly motivated by the strong need of making the best use of user data generated on mobile devices and protecting users’ privacy at the same time. Since we can hardly find any work or research papers about client-based local training, for the rest of this survey, client-based distributed training is referred to as client-based training for convenience. In contrast to traditional machine learning that requires centralized datasets, client-based training uses mobile devices to solve machine learning problems according to local user data. The server aggregates all intermediate results and gets the trained model. Generally speaking, client-based training aims to transfer some computation tasks from centralized servers to decentralized mobile devices. It can not only offload servers’ burden but also make use of the growing processing power on mobile devices. Furthermore, considering that data is processed locally in client-based training, the user data that is either too much to be uploaded or too sensitive to be uploaded can now participate in machine learning tasks. This gives the possibility to improve the model’s accuracy and accelerate the training process. More importantly, besides the benefits mentioned above, client-based training can even better preserve users’ privacy. In this section, we first introduce and explain the motivations of client-based training in Section 5.1.We formally define the task in Section 5.2. Then we discuss the general constraints in Section 5.3. The main challenges faced by client-based training will be claimed in Section 5.4. Finally, we use federated learning and split learning as examples to show the current development of client-based training in Section 5.5 and Section 5.6.

基于客户端的训练主要是出于对充分利用移动设备上生成的用户数据并同时保护用户隐私的强烈需求。由于我们几乎找不到关于基于客户端的本地训练的任何工作或研究论文，因此在本调查的其余部分中，为方便起见，基于客户端的分布式训练称为“基于客户端的训练”。与需要集中数据集的传统机器学习相比，基于客户端的训练使用移动设备根据本地用户数据解决机器学习问题。服务器将汇总所有中间结果并获得经过训练的模型。一般而言，基于客户端的训练旨在将一些计算任务从集中式服务器转移到分散式移动设备。它不仅可以减轻服务器的负担，还可以利用移动设备上不断增长的处理能力。此外，考虑到数据是在基于客户端的训练中本地处理的，因此太多数据无法上传或过于敏感而无法上传的用户数据现在可以参与机器学习任务。这样就可以提高模型的准确性并加快训练过程。更重要的是，除了上述好处之外，基于客户端的训练甚至可以更好地保护用户的隐私。在本节中，我们首先在5.1节中介绍和解释基于客户端的训练的动机，在5.2节中正式定义任务。然后，我们在5.3节中讨论一般约束。基于客户端的训练所面临的主要挑战将在5.4节中提出。最后，我们以联邦学习和拆分学习为例，以在5.5节和5.6节中说明基于客户的培训的最新发展。

## 6 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In this section, we introduce some potential research directions of client-based training. Most of them are motivated by the problems and challenges discussed in Section 5 that have not been studied well (e.g., Non-IID Training Sets). Others are ideas that can improve the robustness or the adaptivity of the system (e.g., General Mobile Training Framework).
