# A Survey of Machine Learning Approaches for Student Dropout Prediction in Online Courses

The recent diffusion of online education (both MOOCs and e-courses) has led to an increased economic and scientific interest in e-learning environments. As widely documented, online students have a much higher chance of dropping out than those attending conventional classrooms. It is of paramount interest for institutions, students, and faculty members to find more efficient methodologies to mitigate withdrawals. Following the rise of attention on the Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) problem, the literature has witnessed a significant increase in contributions to this subject. In this survey, we present an in-depth analysis of the stateof- the-art literature in the field of SDP, under the central perspective, but not exclusive, of machine learning predictive algorithms. Our main contributions are the following: (i) we propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification of existing literature that follows the workflow of design choices in the SDP; (ii) to facilitate the comparative analysis, we introduce a formal notation to describe in a uniform way the alternative dropout models investigated by the researchers in the field; (iii) we analyse some other relevant aspects to which the literature has given less attention, such as evaluation metrics, gathered data, and privacy concerns; (iv)we pay specific attention to deep sequential machine learning methods—recently proposed by some contributors— which represent one of the most effective solutions in this area. Overall, our survey provides novice readers who address these topics with practical guidance on design choices, as well as directs researchers to the most promising approaches, highlighting current limitations and open challenges in the field.

在线教育（MOOC和电子课程）最近的传播导致对电子学习环境的经济和科学兴趣的增加。正如广泛记录的那样，在线学生的辍学几率要比传统教室的高。对于机构，学生和教职员工而言，找到更有效的方法来减少退学是至关重要的。随着对学生辍学预测（SDP）问题的关注日益增加，文献已经见证了对该学科的贡献显着增加。在这项调查中，我们以机器学习预测算法的中心观点（但不是唯一的观点）对SDP领域的最新文献进行了深入分析。我们的主要贡献如下：（i）根据SDP中设计选择的工作流程，对现有文献进行全面的分层分类； （ii）为便于进行比较分析，我们引入了正式的注释，以统一的方式描述了该领域的研究人员研究的替代辍学模型； （iii）我们分析了文献较少关注的其他一些相关方面，例如评估指标，收集的数据和隐私问题； （iv）我们特别关注一些贡献者最近提出的深度顺序机器学习方法，它是该领域最有效的解决方案之一。总体而言，我们的调查为那些针对这些主题的新手读者提供了有关设计选择的实用指导，并指导研究人员找到了最有前途的方法，突出了该领域当前的局限性和开放性挑战。
